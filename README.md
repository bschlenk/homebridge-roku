# homebridge-roku

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-roku.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-roku)

Control your Roku media player from your iOS devices using apple's HomeKit. See [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) for more information controlling 3rd party devices through HomeKit.

## Installation

1. Install globally by running `npm install -g homebridge-roku`
2. Ensure Roku device is turned on
3. Update config file with Roku info by running `homebridge-roku-config --merge`

### Additional Installation Info

A config file must exist at `~/.homebridge/config.json`. See the [sample config file](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge/blob/master/config-sample.json) for an example.

You can run `homebridge-roku-config` by itself to print out the homebride-roku config and manually add it to `~/.homebridge/config.json` if you prefer.

Any time you install a new app, repeat step 3 to update the config file with the app's info. You can also remove apps from the generated config if you don't want to be able to launch them with Siri.

See [homebridge#installing-plugins](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge#installing-plugins) for more information.

## Available Commands

These commands are subject to change and sort of awkward right now.
If I have more time to research homebridge I might try to improve
them, but I probably won't. Feel free to send pull requests with
improvements.

### Hey Siri...
* Turn on RokuPower
* Turn off RokuPower
* Turn on RokuMute
* Turn off RokuMute
* Turn on RokuVolumeUp
* Turn on RokuVolumeDown
* Turn on RokuNetflix
* Turn on Roku{app name}

## Configuration

The amount that volume will be increased or decreased per volume up/down command
can be set in the config. By default, both up and down will be done in
increments of 5. To change this, there are two settings: `volumeIncrement` and
`volumeDecrement`. If only `volumeIncrement` is set, then both volume up and
down will change by the same abount.

## Helping Out

There are many versions of Roku devices, each with a different feature set.
In order to support features across all these devices, it would be helpful to see what
config values each one exposes. If you would like to help out, feel free to add your
config to [this issue](https://github.com/bschlenk/homebridge-roku/issues/9). You can replace
any fields you think are private with "\<redacted\>".

## Limitations

I have only tested this with a [Roku TV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00SG473NO), so there may be more limitations I haven't come across...

The TV cannot be powered on from a powered off state. This could be overcome by adding support for an ir blaster on a raspberry pi and pointing it at the TV. EDIT: According to some, newer Roku TV models support an "ECO" mode that allows the TV to be turned on all the time. The current "Turn on RokuPower" command might just work as is for those, but I have no way of testing because I have an older model.

The current volume level can't be queried, so you can't ask for the volume to be set to a specific value, only relative values can be used. This could be overcome by sending 100 volume down requests before sending X amount of volume up requests. I didn't feel like implementing this for obvious reasons, but pull requests are welcome :)

Homekit doesn't support the speaker service right now which is why
volume has been done using a switch. When it (if ever) does support
the speaker service, volume will be hopefuly be much more natural,
as in "Set RokuVolume to 70" or "Increase RokuVolume by 10".

## Migrating Major Versions

I'm trying to follow strict semver, so major version bumps indicate a breaking
change.

### 1.x.x -> 2.x.x

Roku info now comes back camelcase, and code expects camelcase. Running
`homebridge-roku-config --merge` now merges accessory configs if they
have the same `name` field, so running this once should be enough to
upgrade to `2.x.x`.

## TODO

* Possibly fetch apps at homebridge start time or periodically so that the config
generator doesn't need to be run when new channels are installed.
* Figure out a better way to name the commands, if possible.
For example, "Mute the Roku" instead of "Turn on RokuMute".
